# Detection-Report-Generation-of-Brain-Tumors-using-Deep-Learning

# Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system capable of automatically detecting the presence of brain tumors in medical images, such as MRI scans. The system can differentiate between tumor and non-tumor regions with high accuracy and also highlights the specific image regions critical for its diagnosis.

# Objectives:
The main objectives of the project include:
● To explore and implement traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest, for brain tumor detection.
● To develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture tailored for brain tumor detection, leveraging deep learning techniques.
● To compare the performance of traditional machine learning algorithms and neural networks in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and computational efficiency.
● To provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach and identify areas for further improvement.
